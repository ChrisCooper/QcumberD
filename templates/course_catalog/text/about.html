    <h1>About Qcumber</h1> <h3>The Simple (Unofficial) Course Catalog For Queen's Students</h3>

    <p>
    Qcumber was made with passion by a Queen's undergraduate student. He had a lot of help from his friends.
    <p>

    <p>
    We believe it will help to fill the severe lack of course-finding tools at Queen's University, specifically by providing a more modern way to browse courses and sections.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the days, weeks, and months to come, it will will be updated to include building your timetables, sharing them with friends, and rating courses. The exact set of features that will be added is also up to you!  You can suggest or vote for features <a href="http://qcumber.uservoice.com/">here</a>.
    </p>
