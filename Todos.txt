-add int number to course for ordering
-add ordering property for sections (lecture, lab, ... study)
-When you mouse over a section, display the weekday on the side in visual form, with the section scheduled in. (If the user has sections in there, display them as well.)
-on subject page, button to show course description in dropdown

Optional:
-Add selenium server jar location to qcumber_config (webdriver makes this unnecessary?), and figure out how to run it from django
