-split rows based on top position, so choosing section headers vs. components is easy

-fix entries that are EMPTY or "TBA"

-give basic styling to course detail page and general site

-Add selenium server jar location to qcumber_config (webdriver makes this unnecessary?), and figure out how to run it from django
