Immediate:
Add ordering to Seasons and Terms (dropdown per term)

Consider design


MVP:
-on subject page, button to show course description in dropdown
-consider leaving full text serach for later. for now, use smart navigation a



Optional:
-When you mouse over a section, display the weekday on the side in visual form, with the section scheduled in. (If the user has sections in there, display them as well.)
-add spacing factor in sass for section sparseness
-Add selenium server jar location to qcumber_config (webdriver makes this unnecessary?), and figure out how to run it from django
-Email notifications for changes to selected sections
-For user feedback: http://www.uservoice.com
-Have sidebar with persistent search filters. Apply filters to all results as main pane is updated
-ability for users to supply course webpage
-consider using: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/querysets/#get-or-create
