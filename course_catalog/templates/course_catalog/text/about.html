    <h1>About Qcumber</h1> <h3>The Simple (Unofficial) Course Catalog For Queen's Students</h3>

    <p>
        Qcumber was made with passion by a Queen's undergraduate student named <a href="https://twitter.com/QuixoticChris">Chris</a>, with the help and support of his friends, and at the nudging of one <a href="https://twitter.com/xxbanner">Nissi</a>. The team has now expanded to include the awesome <a href="http://cmetcalfe.ca">Carey</a> and <a href="http://philipschleihauf.ca/">Phil</a>.
    <p>

    <p>
        We believe it will help to fill the severe lack of course-finding tools at Queen's University, specifically by providing a more modern way to browse courses and sections.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you'd like to help out in any way, please drop us a line at <a href="mailto:team@qcumber.ca">team@qcumber.ca</a> to let us know! :) Development at Qcumber has slowed over the past few months, so we're looking for helpers.
    <p>

    <p>
        P.S. Qcumber is open-source! You can check it out on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/ChrisCooper/QcumberD">https://github.com/ChrisCooper/QcumberD</a>.
